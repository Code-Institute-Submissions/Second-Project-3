This site will be an ongoing page, designed to presenting the user the oportunit to book and plan his vacation to his desired destination

It`s creation is for my second milestone project as a Full Stack software developer student of the Code Institute (https://codeinstitute.net/),
with the goal of showcaseing some popular tourist destinations as well as the oportunity to book theb est hotels possible or just pick a
prepalned option out of the selection available.

## UX

The purpose of the site is to allow a lot of freedom for people in choosing travel destinations and an ease of booking for everything

#### User Stories

- As a user I would like help to plan my vacation

- As a person who has not fully decided his travel desstination, I would like an opotunity to see and possibly choose different vacation plan options.

## Features

### Existing Features

- **Home page** - The home page contains most of the current features. There are 3 main sections - the first one shows future plans that I have for this website as in booking lfights or creating your own schedule, second one
  is a popular picture of a famous tourist site in hopes it helps the user choose his next ravel destination properly and third part is the map
  with the function to pick yuor desired country and book a respective hotel there.

### Features Left to Implement

## Testing

1.  http://ami.responsivedesign.is/ has been used to see how the site performs on different devices and their viewports, all pages, links, icons performed as expected on all devices. I also used it to create the AmIResponsive.PNG at the top of this Readme.

## Deployment

1. Created a Github account at https://github.com
   My account url; https://github.com/NihtianAtanasov

2. I uploaded all files to my Github repository located at this url; https://github.com/NihtianAtanasov/Second-Project which is for this individual project.

3. To publish the project to see it on the web, I then went into the Settings on my respository, scrolled down to the heading, GitHub Pages. Under the Source setting, I used the drop-down menu to select master branch as a publishing source and saved it. Refreshed the github page, and you are then given a url where your page is published;
   Your site is published at https://nihtianatanasov.github.io/First-Project/

4. To run this code on your local machine, you would go to my respository at
   https://github.com/NihtianAtanasov/First-Project and on the home page on the right hand side just above all the files, you will see a green button that says,
   "Clone or download", this button will give you options to clone with HTTPS, open in desktop or download as a zip file.
   To continue with cloning, you would;

- Open Git Bash
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type git clone, and then paste this URL; https://github.com/NihtianAtanasov/First-Project Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
